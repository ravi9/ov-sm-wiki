These steps explain how to install Python3 and Git on macOS.

## 1. Install Python

* Download a Python installer from python.org. Choose Python 3.6, 3.7 or 3.8, and make sure to pick an x86-64 version. For example, this 3.7 installer: 
https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.7.9/python-3.7.9-amd64.exe
* Double click on the installer to run it, and follow the steps in the installer. Check the box to add Python to your PATH, and to install `py`. At the end of the installer, there is an option to disable the PATH length limit. It is recommended to click this.

## 2. Install GIT. 

* Download [GIT](https://git-scm.com/download/mac) from [this link](https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/releases/download/v2.31.1.windows.1/Git-2.31.1-64-bit.exe)
* Double click on the installer to run it, and follow the steps in the installer.

After installing Python3 and Git, you can follow the instructions in the main README to [install OpenVINO and the notebooks](https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/openvino_notebooks).
