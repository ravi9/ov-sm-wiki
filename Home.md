# OpenVINO Notebooks Wiki

## Installation

The [OpenVINO Notebooks README](https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/openvino_notebooks) provides instructions for how to install and get started with the notebooks. These instructions assume that you have Python and Git installed already, and that Python is installed with a system installer. Here you can find more detailed installation guides. If you run into an issue, please feel free to open a [discussion topic](https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/openvino_notebooks/discussions)! Note the system requirements in the main README though: Python 3.9 is not currently supported by OpenVINO.
