## Running Cells

To run a cell, click on the _run_ button in the top bar, or use the keyboard: ctrl-click runs the cell and keeps the current cell selected, shift-click runs the cell and moves to the next cell.

The _Run_ and _Kernel_ menus have several options for running all or a selection of cells, including the often useful _Restart Kernel and Run up to Selected Cell_

## Upload your Own Image/Video

## Show Table of Contents

Jupyter Lab has a built-in table of contents feature that is useful for navigating in larger notebooks. To enable it, click on the icon with three bars at the left of the screen. Click on the top icon, that looks like a folder, to go back to the file explorer view.
