## Running Cells

To run a cell, click on the _run_ button in the top bar, or use the keyboard: ctrl-click runs the cell and keeps the current cell selected, shift-click runs the cell and moves to the next cell.

## Show Table of Contents

Jupyter Lab has a built-in table of contents feature that is useful for navigating in larger notebooks. To enable it, click on the icon with three bars at the left of the screen. Click on the top icon, which looks like a folder, to go back to the file explorer view.
